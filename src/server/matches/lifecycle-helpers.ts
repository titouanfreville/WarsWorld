 * straight from the DB. `turn` isn't persisted for archived matches — the history UI keys off the
 * result, not the day count (the real day count comes from `endgame.summary`, which replays the log).
 *
 * `leagueType`/`isRanked`/`finishedAt` ride along so the history list can label and filter a row
 * without a per-row `endgame.summary` call — that one replays the whole event log, so it stays
 * lazy behind the row's expand.
